Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
		
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

this is the application of engineering entailing designing,development,testing,deployment and maintainance of software products.it has helped 
industries develop systems that has improved various aspects in life such as communication and health care
		

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
		
development of programming languages such as c
establishment of software engeneering as adiscipline
the rise of agile methadologies 
		
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
		
1)requirements-this involves identifying users needs and system requirements
2)design-creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
3)implementation-write the code and build the software acording to design specification
4)testing-various test should be conducted to ensure that the software attains the quality standards and functional requirements
5)deployment-release the software to consumers
6)maintainance-after deployment constant support,updates and software enhancements should be provided
		
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methadology is the sequential approach with distinct phases such as requirements, design and implementation while agile methadology is 
the incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
		
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a software developer is responsible for writing code and impllementing software solutions, quality assuarance engineer ensures software quality by 
desining and executing tests and project manager oversees the planning ,execution and delivery of software systems
		
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give 
examples of each.
		
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code and such as visual studio code while VCS help in tracking changes to source
code and coordinating work among team members such as Git
		
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

challenges faced by software engeeners incude changing requirements needed during development which leads to delays and tight deadlines for its 
completion.ways to overcome this is by prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
		
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. 

Unit Testing:involves Testing individual components or modules of software to ensure each unit performs as intended
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems for smooth work flow
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole to ensure usability
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
		

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
		
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
		
prompt engineering is the instructing of a generative ai in a detailed manner to receive a desired output 
		
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt-generate a picture of a car.improved prompt-generate a picture of an old school darkblue car on a road with a mountain view in its background
The improved prompt is effective due to the clarity of what the image should look like and its
